# About GoobyFRS

Hello everyone - I am [GoobyFRS](https://linktr.ee/goobyfrs) out on the internet and in video games. I mostly play simulator and racing games but I can get into just about anything. This page is more about my 'online' persona and not so much me as a person or business. If you are interested, here are my other links.

## Goobs Curated Blacklist

This is a blacklist for Pi-Hole / AdGuard Home that I actively maintain based on my home adblocking usage.
