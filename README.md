# About GoobyFRS

Hello everyone - I am [GoobyFRS](https://linktr.ee/goobyfrs) out on the internet and in video games. I mostly play simulator and racing games but I can get into just about anything. Here are some of my other links.

## Goobs Curated Blacklist

This is a blacklist for Pi-Hole / AdGuard Home that I actively maintain based on my home adblocking usage. However it may not be super effective for you. This is only a collection of my other 10 adlists did not catch. Popular adlists by other CONTRIBUTORs can be found at [Firebog](https://firebog.net/)

#### My Referral Links

I do not typically like Referral links. Atleast, not for individuals such as my self. Often feels more like a MLM scheme than anything. But these two companies below get my money, in real life, every month. I like them. Maybe you will too.

1. [ProtonMail Plus](https://pr.tn/ref/9E1AC5Q1T3Z0)
    > I've been using the ProtonMail Unlimited plan for over a year. This was a major step in my efforts to de-Google-Fi my life and increase my security and privacy. I get decent use out of the entire ecosystem and I strongly encourage everyone who reads this to do their own research and investigate a path to de-Google-fy'ing.

2. [Linode](https://www.linode.com/lp/refer/?r=d46f7cf236f69208c12b9ebc684046a2f8516247)
    > Linode hosts my personal WordPress website. I also use the S3 storage and Self-Service DNS. I've had 4 experiences with their Support Teams and can vouch they are awesome. What got me on to Linode, is that they sponsor my households favorite YouTube channel; [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/c/level1techs)
